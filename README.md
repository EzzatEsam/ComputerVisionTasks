# Computer Vision Tasks

This repository contains multiple computer vision projects under active development.

## Projects

- [cloth-seg/](cloth-seg/)
  - Segmentation of clothing items in images using PyTorch Lightning. Includes training (`train.py`), inference (`infer.py`), data loaders, and saved checkpoints.
  - See project details in [cloth-seg/README.md](cloth-seg/README.md).

- [face-match-age/](face-match-age/)
  - Face age estimation and matching utilities with CACD dataset support. Contains training (`train.py`), inference (`infer.py`), and experiment logs.
  - See project details in [face-match-age/README.md](face-match-age/README.md).

- [testing-styleclip/](testing-styleclip/)
  - Experimental setup for StyleCLIP-based edits.

## Notes
- For per-project setup, usage, and checkpoints, refer to each folder's README and REPORT.md.
